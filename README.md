## Beta Content

Some beta content makes sense to be restored rather than replaced, not going to explain every change, but there are reasons for them.

- Restored unused Feltzer ad in airport.
- Restored beta roof texture on Woodfellas warehouse in East Hook.
- Restored unused shop signs in Hove Beach.
- Restored unused painting texture in Playboy X apartment (which was reused in TBoGT, but anyway).
- Restored beta Drusilla's look, it makes more sense because of these reasons:
  - Waitresses became visible.
  - Windows from interior correspond the ones from exterior.
  - Fixes double entry door.
  - Corresponds all in-game photos of this place.
- Restored beta roof texture at Brucie's garage, as well as the roofs of several buildings near this garage.
- Restored missing ads on the Algonquin - Dukes expressway near the bus depot.
- Restored ad close to police station in Hove Beach.
- Restored unused "Ammu Nation" shop sign in front of the Maisonette 9 nightclub.
- Added transparency to carwash roof windows in Purgatory.
- Restored some missing billboards in East Island City.
