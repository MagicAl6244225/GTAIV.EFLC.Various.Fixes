This mod has three installation options: manual, automatic and through Fusion Fix modloader or overloader system.

Manual Installation
All files need to drag and drop with replacement, path to each file is made with folders. Yes, this installation is long and boring, but there is automatic one.

Auto-Installation
This is "update.img" method, which includes a lot of files for main game (IV).
To install it, just drop the "update" folder into the game folder, then check pc and common folders and drop all files from there with replacement, or just drop these two folders with file replacement.
This method does not work with EFLC files, so fixes for EFLC you can install only manually, but if you using updated version of Fusion Fix mod, then you can install this mod and not even replace anything.

Installation through Fusion Overloader
Installation method is the same as automatic one, just drop "update" folder into the game folder and that's all you need to do, start your game and check if mod is working.

Now some notes about installation options:

Manual Installation contains "Update 1.5" folder, if you are installing this mod for the first time, then do not touch that folder, files from there are already included in all installations.
If you have installed mod before, then install files from this folder to save time.

Auto-Installation option does not work on some patches.
As far as I found out, this method does not work on patch 1.0.4.0 and below probably, but works on 1.0.7.0 and 1.0.8.0, so if it either does not work for you or breaks the game, you can simply remove "update" folder and try manual installation.
Thanks to catsmackaroo for suggestion and detailed explanation of this method.

Installation through Fusion Overloader
This installation option works only for Complete Edition users (at least at the time of mod update).
